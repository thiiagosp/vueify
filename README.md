# THIS REPOSITORY IS AN UPDATE OF VUEJS/VUEIFY

This repo aims to help those who are using already Vueify and want to keep updated even knowing that the original repo isn't giving update anymore, I'm trying to do some effort to keep this lib up to date (e.g support to babel@7 that already works) and any contribution would be amazingly helpful.

## Usage

``` bash
npm install vueify-babel-7-support --save-dev
```
